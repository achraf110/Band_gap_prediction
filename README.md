# Band_gap_prediction
In this project , I have used an experimental Band gap of semiconductors Data from Matminer Library. Linear Regression and Random Forest  Regression has been used, with the help of Pymatgen Library I has extracted some features from each Crystal structure. There has been 3895 Type of semiconductors that has been fed to the model.
